# CVE-2019-7609 Kibana RCE (Fixed Exploit Script)

This is a fixed and tested version of an exploit for **CVE-2019-7609**, a remote code execution vulnerability in **Kibana versions < 6.6.1**, leveraging prototype pollution in the *Timelion* plugin.

The original exploit by [LandGrey](https://github.com/LandGrey/CVE-2019-7609) contained a bug where `re.findall()` was used on a bytes object, which caused a `TypeError`. This version fixes that issue and was tested successfully on the *Kiba* room in TryHackMe.

---

## 🛠 Fix Summary

- ✅ Changed `re.findall(pattern, r.content)` to `re.findall(pattern, r.text)`
- ✅ Suppressed insecure request warnings
- ✅ Added version printing and clearer output
- ✅ Verified on TryHackMe box with Kibana 6.5.4
